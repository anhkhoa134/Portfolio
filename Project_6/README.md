### Overview

- 2016 lack of data
- The daily revenue is relatively even
- There is a difference in revenue each month, in the last months of the year, revenue decreases

- Most orders have been delivered to customers (96.34%)
- About 1000 Canceled and Invoiced applications: need for customer service staff to track the cause and fix it

- The main form of payment is Credit Card
- Using the voucher is only 2.37%, need to find out if the customer doesn't want to use it or doesn't know how to use it

- Revenue is heavily concentrated in State “SP” and City “Sao Paulo”, accounting for nearly half of the company's total revenue
- State “AC”, “AP”, “RR” have less than 100 orders and many cities only have 1 order

### Customers

- New customers are not many, leading to low revenue growth in the period 2017-2018
- 1-star review accounts for 11.86%, the rate is too high, need to review the quality of products and services
- In addition, those 1-star reviews are from customers who have a high purchase rate, many orders and very high value per unit => need to stop immediately, look at the cause and fix it immediately.

### Diagnostic and Predictive

- Revenue is concentrated too much in State(SP, RJ) and City (sao paulo, rio de janeiro).
  - The advantage is that just specializing in sales and improving services, as well as taking care of customers in that City, has brought enough profit for the company's operations. Save a lot of cost and manpower
  - But that proves the company is not capable of macro development in many areas, the revenue in other places is too meager. Must retrain personnel to develop that area or recruit new talent

- As mentioned in Overview, Vouchers are used sparingly by customers, there is no policy to attract new customers and retain old customers.
- The rate of old customers leaving the company is very high
- Promising accounts for 43.24%, used to be loyal customers who buy many times with large spending who have not bought from us for a long time
  - Give them a Voucher to bring them back to use our products
  - Talking to them offers personalized recommendations that keep them engaged
  - These customers are also customers who have rated 1 star many times mentioned in Customers. Need to chat to come up with a solution is it because of the product or service,…
- Cannot Lose Theme accounts for 28.65%, customers with such a large wallet are easy to lose from the opponent's hand.
  - Extend services or offer special offers on outstanding new products
  - Chat for as much personalization as possible
- New Customers 5.93%, this is the reason why other cities only have 1 order
  - New campaigns, relationship building
- Similar to other customer segments
- Revenue grew well until the second quarter of 2018 began to slow down and slide, typically in the third quarter of 2018 it fell -37.3%. At the same time last year, it increased +31.05%
- As mentioned above, revenue decreases due to no new customers, old customers leave us, current customers are using low frequency.
